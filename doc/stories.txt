Table displays values in graph

As a visitor looking at the parallel coordinates graph,
I want each line in the table to represent one line in the graph,
So that I can see the identity and value of each data point.

Given that I'm looking at class Mammalia,
Then I should see a row for each order that belongs to class Mammalia.

- Start with a name column.
- Columns should be ordered in the same sequence as the axes.
- No pagination. All records should be displayed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Table is sortable

As a visitor looking at the parallel coordinates graph,
I want sort the table of values by any of the columns,
In order to quickly identify interesting data points.

- Sort by any column. 
- It should not require a page reload.
- No need for the sorting status to be reflected in the URL (i.e. linkable).
  It's fine to implement this solely in the widget.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Display all combinations of aggregations in table(s)

As a visitor looking at the parallel coordinates graph,
I want to see all the different values of aggregations for each variable,
So that I can better understand the distribution of values in the data.

Right now we're only calculating average. For each of the 4 variables (lifespan, birth weight, adult weight, litter size), calculate and display each of these 4 aggregations:
- Average
- Minimum
- Maximum
- Standard Deviation

The UI for this story is temporary. It's a simple view intended to expose the fact that the different aggregations are being calculated for each variable. A later story will allow the user to select between 2 and 8 variable/aggregations to display. But for now we're just going to show them all (currently 16 combinations, until we get more variables).

- Displaying these values should be just as fast as displaying the current data.
- Like the current data, the values do not need to be perfectly up to date. It's fine if they're say, an hour out of date.
- Since this is a temporary view of the data, it's fine to display this as four tables, one for each aggregation. So in addition to the current "average" table, there will be a similar table for minimums, a similar table for maximums, etc.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Units are scaled to appropriate magnitude

As a visitor looking at the parallel coordinates graph,
I want the units to be scaled to a precision 
	such that I'm never looking at values greater than 1000,
So that the numbers are easier to read and understand. 

Given that I'm looking at class Mammalia,
And there is a order who has a birth weight value of 150_000 grams,
Then I should see it represented as 150kg.

Given that I'm looking at class Mammalia,
And there is an order who has a lifespan of 10_000 days,
Then I should see it represented as 27 years.

- Scale time to days, months, or years.
- Scale weight to grams or kilograms.
- If value is still greater than 999, use commas to separate thousands.
- Do this anywhere numbers are displayed; axes limits, table cells, etc.
- Implies that units will need to be displayed within table cells along with
  values, since different units could occur within one column.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A user can select which variable/aggregation combinations to display in the table

As a visitor looking at the parallel coordinates graph,
I want to be able to select which variables and which aggregations to display
	in the table,
So that I can isolate only the combinations that are interesting to me.

Given that I'm on the "Adjust Axes" screen,
When I set my first axis to "Minimum Lifespan",
And I set my second axis to "Maximum Lifespan",
And I set my third axis to "Standard Deviation Birth Weight",
And I set my fourth axis to "Standard Deviation Adult Weight",
And I set my fifth axis to "Average Litter Size",
And I click "Done",
Then I should see the standard fixed axes in the parallel coordinates graph,
And I should see the data table with my selected columns and values.

With this story, we go back to showing one table. 

- The graph is unaffected by this story. It continues to have fixed axes.
- I can add new axes, up to a maximum of 8 (at developer's discretion).
- I can remove axes, down to a minimum of 2 (need at least that much for graph, eventually).
- I can modify any axis.
- Not able to drag/drop reorder axes (no need). Can just modify/add/remove them.

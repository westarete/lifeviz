  Clean Install from scratch
    1. make sure you have anage.xml, hagrid_ubid.txt, and ubiota_taxonomy.psv in db/data folder
    2. create new database
    3. rake db:schema:load
    4. run db:seed (~4hrs)
        - create_taxonomy
        - create_species_and_data
    5. enter console and Taxon.rebuild! (~4hrs)
    6. get into psql
       $psql lifeviz_development
    7. run vacuum (5mins)
    8. #vacuum analyze;
    9. run Species.rebuild_stats (2.5mins for 4k species)
    10. run Taxon.rebuild_stats
    11. at this point you may want to run Taxon.rebuild_lineages! from console since we performed a vacuum analyze and things are faster
    12. script/server
